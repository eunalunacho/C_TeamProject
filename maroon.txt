Maroon 5 sugar
Nicki Minaj, Maroon 5, Let's go
Yo, I got them Now & Laters, and them Jolly Ranchers too
It ain't a question, but I got the answers too
These shoes is Cavalli, and the pants is too
When I see him I'mma strip like the dancers do
Imma show them how to do it like the pamphlets do
Show these girls how to do it off campus too
Yo, as long as you know he got the baddest, I'm flattered
I'm the only one that he answers to
And if you need it (need it) then I'mma put it on ya
Ain't nothin' sweeter, you want this sugar, don't ya?
Up, down, inside, water park it, slip slide
Would'a, could'a, should'a got ya sugar, get ya sugar
You sugar, yes please
Would you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah you show me good
